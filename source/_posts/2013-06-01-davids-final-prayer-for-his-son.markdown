> And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.
>
><cite>1 Chronicles 29:19</cite>

Stop and think for a moment. If you only had one more chance to pray for your child, what would you pray for? Would you pray for a long, healthy life? Maybe you'd pray that they would be blessed with financial success. Would it be that they remain happy throughout their days? David had come to the end of his days. We have read his last recorded prayer for his son, Solomon. However, David did not pray for Solomon to have a great kingdom, good health, an abundance of riches, or a happy life.

Isn't it fitting that a man after God's own heart prayed that his son should have a perfect heart? David is praying for a complete heart, a fully restored heart, and a heart at peace. David wants Solomon's heart to be fixed on God and complete in Him. David is also playing on Solomon's name here. Solomon's name is related linguistically to this word perfect. I believe David is praying that Solomon live up to his namesake. David had blood on his hands which prevented him from fulfilling his desires for God. David was praying that Solomon wouldn't make the same mistakes.

Notice the distinction David makes between keeping God's word and doing it. David wasn't just praying that Solomon would live right, but that he'd treasure the word of God. The picture is that Solomon would put God's word in a protected place in his life and hedge it about. David knew that if Solomon hid the word of God in his heart, that it'd ensure his heart would be perfect. He knew that Solomon could never perform it, until he had esteemed it. David desired that Solomon know God and live for him.

The final thing we find David praying for is for Solomon to stay in the will of God. God had allowed David to set in motion the planning and provisioning of the temple. God had told David that his son would build it. David prays that Solomon does not stray from the will of God and remains on the path God had laid out for him. David knew God's plans were right and perfect. David trusted God's plans were far greater than his own. Therefore, David petitioned that Solomon would do that which God would have him to do.

I challenge you to pray like David. This is a wonderful prayer for your children. This is a wonderful prayer for yourself.
