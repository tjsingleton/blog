>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

Poor abused catalogs, by now not one of them isn't dog-eared, marked up, and cut to pieces as with wide eyes we compile our Christmas list. How long is your? We may make a lot of noise about how Christmas is a time of giving and not receiving. The ravished state of the weekend sales ads tells a different story. I've come to realize there is a lot more wanting    going on than giving or receiving.

We all have wants: Big, small, silly and serious. We all have felt this   disappointment and discouragement of not getting what we want. Read the following sentence very carefully.

<p style="text-align: center;">**What you want may not be what you want.**</p>

Have you ever considered the consequences of getting what you want? Or for that matter, the benefits of not getting what you want? The Israelites wanted to be like other nations. they wanted a king. We know that turned out not to be for their good (1 Sam 8:10-20). Paul prayed repeatedly for the thorn in his flesh until God revealed that it was placed there for Paul's spiritual good (2 Cor 12:7-10).

Paul had learned to be content. He learned to trust God. He knew God loved him and was in control of every aspect of life. He rested in that God would strengthen Paul to accomplish the Lord's will. Paul yielded his wants to his heavenly Father. The world may measure Paul's account as ending only with a few books and a cloak (2 Tim 4:13). However, Paul possessed something far greater, He possessed Christ (Gal 2:20).

We sing that Christ is all we need. Is he all you want? Dear friend, truly he is all we have.
