>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
>
><cite>Hebrews 13:15</cite>

Burnt orange leaves rustling in the chilly wind reminds us that the holiday season is just around the corner. The festivities begin with a day set aside for us to express thankfulness for our many blessings. However, on the christian's calendar every day should be marked by such gratitude to the father of light from which ever good and perfect give originates (James 1:17).

The writer of Hebrews admonishes us to offer God praise continually. As the earth  steadfastly revolves around around the sun, so our hearts should be fixed in an orbit of appreciation for our great and wonderful God. Our lives should be marked by the constant recognition of our God.

Notice too that we are called not just to silent meditation, but also to burst forth with a vocal demonstration of our thanksgiving to God. We are to offer him the sacrifice of our lips. We are to speak and sing of his goodness that others may be hear and be reminded.

Finally, unlike the world who's focus seemly revolves around what they have. Our thankfulness should be grounded in who we have. We are called to give thanks to his name. In this context, the name signifies the character and attributes of who God is. Every one of his excellencies provides us great cause for rejoicing.

Let us raise our voices daily, not just annually in thanksgiving. Let us recognize the worth of the giver, not just the gift. Let us praise him continually.
