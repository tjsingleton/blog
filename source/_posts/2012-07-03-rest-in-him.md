>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

In the high pace time we live, tiredness is something we all have experienced. It’s likely that very recently with a frazzled countenance you proclaimed to a loved one, “I am exhausted.” Fatigue is a common, early symptom of diverse ailments. There are times in our Christian life when we are not physically taxed, but spiritually drained. Even Elijah came to a point in life where he sat sapped shaded beneath a juniper tree (1 Kings 19:4).

Aren’t you glad that as Christians we have a remedy? We can have rest. Christ offers it to us with only one requirement. We must go to him. He bids us come with the promised result of rest. Are you worn, weak, or weary? Has the circumstances and cares of life burdened you down? Do you feel depleted and spent? Then go to him and you will find rest you need.

He calls us to put on his yoke. He wants to carry the load. How do we take his yoke? We learn of him. Moreover, we learn him. The more we know him, the more we have to rest in. When we learn how he supplies us, we rest in his provisions. When we learn how he supports us, we rest strength. When we learn how he succors us, we rest in his comfort. The knowledge and understanding of our loving Lord provides us footings to rest upon.

Job feared God. When his life was turned upside down and he suffered such great loss, he could worship the LORD (Job 1). He rested in God. You can go to him. You can learn of him. You can rest in him.
