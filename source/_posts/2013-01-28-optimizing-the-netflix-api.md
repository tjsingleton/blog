I appreciate <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> and other companies who are willing to share their experience from the field. In this post talks about the problems and solutions they faced when building an api for different devices and clients. It's a continuation of a previous post they made on a move away from a single REST API to api's customized to the api consumers.
