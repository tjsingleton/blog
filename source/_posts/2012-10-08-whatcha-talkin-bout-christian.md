>Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.

>Psa 119:27

People love to talk. Hours can pass by unaware when folks are engrossed in a good conversation. To support our desire to talk in November 2011 there were 331.6 million cell phone subscriptions in the US. What amazed me is there are only 311.5 million people according the the census published months earlier. People want to make sure that you can give them a ring anywhere they might be. 

With all that time spent talking, let me ask you this probing question; "What are you talking about?" The psalmist desired of God to understand the word of the Lord. He declared that when he was made to understand that he would speak of the wondrous works of our awesome God. Is your dialog filled with recounting the mighty and marvelous works of the Lord? 

If the answer is no then maybe it's time for you to get back into God's word. The more you learn about our God, the more words of praise will leave your lips and ascend unto his ear. Saturate your mind in the water of the word, so that your speech blossom with adoration for him. 

Are his works not wonderful to you? Are they not worthy of your mention? What is it that you are talking about?
