This is my first attempt at trying to preach to a solely internet audience. I was driving to school, and plugged in my microphone and let it rip. It this turns out well it will be just the start with more to come later.

I try to give three reasons form the scripture on why our hope of eternal life is secure and sure in Christ Jesus, our Lord. Out Text for this study if found in Titus 1:2, which states "In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;". Let us now tune in and listen to the truth of God's word on our blessed hope in Christ Jesus and how sure it is!

1. Our Hope is Sure because of the Promise of God
2. Our Hope is Sure because of the Person of God
3. Our Hope is Sure because of the Plan of God
