I got bored last night with my guitar so I fired up <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">audicity</a> and played a couple bars of a song we sing at church. The Chorus goes like this "I love Jesus, Hallelujah. I love Jesus, Yes, I do. I love Jesus, He's my saviour, Jesus smiles and loves me too.

Anyways, <a href="http://tjsingleton.name/mp3/guitarclip.mp3">this clip</a> is the outcome of that.
