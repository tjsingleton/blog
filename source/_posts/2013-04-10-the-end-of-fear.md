>The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.

><cite>Psalm 27:1-3</cite>

The psalmist confidently proclaims that he is fearless. He declares that he has no anxiety, unease, or worry. He doesn't just say this once, he repeats himself again and again. He is making sure we understand that he is not the least nervous or alarmed.

Why should he be afraid? It's David, King of Israel. It's David, the man after God's heart. However, we noticed that all is not sunshine and daisies in his life. His enemies are against him. He's surrounded, overwhelmed, and cornered. In such a time of trouble, why wouldn't David be afraid?

Fear, worry, and doubt are the opposites of faith. David isn't afraid because of his trust in the Lord. He is confident that his life is in the Lord's hand. He is sure of the strength, power, and mercy of God. David knew the Lord. No situation, No circumstances, No foe could trouble David. His fate was secure in God's hands.

What are you afraid of? What has you made you to fret? What is it keeping you awake at night trembling? Is the Lord not your light and salvation? Is he not the strength of your life? Whom shall you fear? The fear of the Lord is the end of fear.
