First things first, mine did not come out the same lovely pale orange color. What is the trick there? The comments point out that browning the vegetables longer would help here. It did, however, turn out to be good.

I wasn't crazy though about the creamed corn. It really influenced the flavor more that I would have liked and there wasn't enough kernels. Maybe next I'll try equal parts cream corn and whole kernels.

The ingredients do not mention salt or pepper which I thought was odd. I added a liberal amount of both. I really like a healthy dose of the pepper. The bitterness contrast the richness of the milk. The author does make mention in the comments that she seasons to taste at the end.

I substituted the rendered bacon fat for the olive oil, because I'm that kind of guy. I also let it simmer for about 3 hours past what the recipe called for. I had a bowl according to the recipe, but the flavors hadn't had time to marry yet. Also, the chicken wasn't very tender after 20 minutes. It was _much better_ after the 3 hours.

I left the bacon slightly bigger than "bacon bits". I think it would have helped to diffuse the flavor more to chop it finer. Adding an extra slice or two wouldn't hurt either. I also wish I would have left some of the bacon as a crunchy topper at the end.
