Too often I feel like I've been involved with teams where estimation was done solely as a ritual and had no actual use.
I understand there are situations for where there is a legitimate use in estimation. I think Fowler is spot-on when in
his proposition that, "estimation is valuable when it helps you make a significant decision."
