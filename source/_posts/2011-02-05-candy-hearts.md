>My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

It's that time again, Valentines day is right around the corner. The grocery and drugs stores already have up the displays filled will the season's novelties. You can always count on that there will be an endless variety of pepto-colored candy hearts. You know the one's I'm talking about that taste like chalk and have cute sayings like "Be mine" and "My love." The Shulammite expressed those same thoughts to her beloved. 

She begins by expressing the rapport that is shared. It's not just anyone she is talking about, it's her beloved. That sweet, term of endearment reveals her heart's feeling towards Solomon. She has been taken by his beauty and must voice her love for him.

This would be a tragic tale if her love was denied, but on the contrary she builds upon her report and expresses a relationship. "My beloved is mine," she claims. Mine? She is exerting a sense of ownership over Solomon, that Solomon in some way belongs to her. What right does this lowly shulammite have to the great king Solomon? She would have none, were it not for the reciprocation from Solomon. 

She finishes, "And I am his:" Not only does she love Solomon, but he loves her. Not only has she claimed Solomon, but he has claimed her. They have given themselves selflessly one to the other. 

In the same way, we can express the preciousness of Christ to us. He is our beloved! We, who loved the dark, have been overcome the brilliance of His light and fallen in love with Him. We, who are unworthy, have taken the King of Kings as our own. And thanks be to God, we do so because He first loved us and took us for His own.
