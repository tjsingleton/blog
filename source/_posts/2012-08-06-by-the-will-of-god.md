>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
>
><cite>Ephesians 1:1</cite>

The apostle Paul is writing a letter to the church that was at Ephesus. As was custom, he begins by introducing who he is and who he is writing to. This is Paul's standard letterhead; It is shared with the majority of his epistles. I imagine you would be apt to read right over this verse. 

Notice though what Paul is saying. He is an apostle by the will of God. His position wasn't his choice. Paul claimed to be the chief of sinners. Before the Lord saved Paul, he was church  enemy number one. The God who saved Paul, also called him to be a apostle. 

If you were to sit down to pen a letter to the church at New  Canaan what is it that you would claim you are by the will of God? The same Lord that placed Paul in his position has a purpose for you as well. You have a place. You have a role. You have a ministry to perform to the glory of God.

Paul was certain that God had made him an apostle. We also don't find where he disputed his place. Paul accepted that God had the authority to choose where he served. Have you accepted the job that God has called you to do? Have you tried to circumvent God for a duty that you'd be more inclined to? 

Child of God, there is something God wants you to be. What are you by his will? How will you start your letter?
