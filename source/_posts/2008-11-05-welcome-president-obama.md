I would like to say welcome Mr. President Obama. No, you were not my choice. However, I believe in the constitution. I believe in democracy. I believe in America.

Moreover, I believe in God.<!--more--> He is the one who allows leaders to rise to power (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%202.21;&amp;version=9;">Daniel 2.21</a>). He is the one who can direct their hearts (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2021:1;&amp;version=9;">Proverbs 21:1</a>). The reason you were elected president is because of him.

I would point out that God granting you this position is not a revelation of his favor, but that is not the purpose of this writing. I have set out to establish that you now have my prayers (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim%202:1-2;&amp;version=9;">1 Tim 2:1-2</a>), my honor (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:17;&amp;version=9;">1 Peter 2:17</a>), and my pledge to not speak evil against you (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2023:5;&amp;version=9;">Acts 23:5</a>). Welcome Mr. President. May God help you, and may he help America.
