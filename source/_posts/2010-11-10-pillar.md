>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.

Driving around Georgia we often pass by an old plantation homes. These homes have stood for years. One of the one of they distinguishing features was the use of columns. These pillars have supported the weight of the house through many storms.

Paul describes James, Cephas, and John as pillars. The idea of being a pillar is not that of leadership, but of support. These men had a reputation of underpinning the church.

The root word for pillar means to stand. When we lay down, our weight is supported by the bed. When we sit, the chair supports our weight. However, when we stand we are supporting ourself.

We need people who are pillars in the church. We need people that help support fellow christians. We need people who are stable and strong. People who like the columns on the plantation house can stand the test of time.

How about you? Are you a pillar?
