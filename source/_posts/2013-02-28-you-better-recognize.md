>Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.

><cite>Hebrews 13:5</cite>

It's 1 am. Emily is asleep. The wind lightly blows against the house. The compressor on the fridge grumbles along. Outside of this, there is silence. You might think that I'm alone. You'd be wrong. 

Nothing can separate me from the Lord. His presence thrills my soul. No matter how dark this night gets, it can't cut me off from Him. We find revealed here a truth nearly too wonderful to comprehend. The Lord won't leave us. He won't forsake us. We are never alone. 
The psalmist said, "If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there."  (Ps 139:8) There is no where the psalmist could go and escape the omnipresent one. 

What battles are you struggling through? What situation has you neck deep treading water trying to keep afloat? Dear Christian, recognize that you are in the presence of God. Recognize that he hasn't left you. Recognize and  enjoy it. After all, if you have him, what else do you need?
