Google reports that the current trends for those  exact search terms is 100 people a month and there have been 5,353 searches since September 2006. I have wonderful news for you and all those people desiring to answer this question once and for all. There is an absolute authority on how to be attractive. No, you won't find the answer within the pages of the magazines lining the supermarket aisle. It is however  contained in one of the best selling books of all times.

So you want to know how to be more attractive? It's really, really simple. Praise the Lord. Yes sir, according to God's word praise is comely for the upright. We don't use that word comely too often today, but it's just another word for           attractive. I admit, this wonderful truth isn't going to help us to win any beauty pageants. It does however teach us how to please God.

What does God find pleasing? What appeals to him? Worship. "Rejoice in the Lord," demands the Psalmist. We talk about wanting a move of God. We say we want see God manifest his presence. Having said that, are we rolling out the red     carpet for him? Are we inviting him with our praise?

Why don't you take a moment right now and gussy yourself up for God with your praise?
