I recently was asked the definition of missions. Here is my attempt to sum up it's essence into an apt statement.

>Missions is the duty of the church, in which we as the redeemed in gratitude and love get the privileged to announce the riches of our redemption to those who are lost as we once were. That the Holy Spirit chooses to work in, arresting the heart of men and granting them the gift of repentance unto life.
