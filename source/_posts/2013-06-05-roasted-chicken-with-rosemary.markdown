Em and I enjoyed this a couple weeks ago. The chicken was moist and wonderful. While it was good, it was underseasoned. The flavors are solid, it's just not very strong. Next time, I'll double the garlic, salt, pepper, and rosemary. One thing is for sure, the butter really shines in this dish. My only other observation is it lacks anything acidic. I think a little lemon would be a nice addition and add some contrast.
