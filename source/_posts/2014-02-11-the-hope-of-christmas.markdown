> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God,  The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.

If we are not careful at Christmas we will only look back towards the past. It's seems natural to do so. We have just come out of        Thanksgiving where we examined the blessings of God on us in the last year. We're quickly approaching the end of the year and the      media begins recapping the most memorable events. As Christians, we know that Christmas is a time to celebrate the birth of Christ, an event which took place over two-thousand years ago. Why wouldn't we focus on the past?

However, as we read the prophecy of the birth of Jesus, it points past just the events surrounding a manger. It points past today. It points to our blessed hope in the future.

The Christmas story doesn't end at the temple with Simeon and Anna. It doesn't end with Christ on the cross. It doesn't even end with his resurrection. It ends with his revelation!

Yes! Jesus was born of a virgin. Yes! Christ died for our sins. Yes! His sacrifice was accepted and he rose that glorious third day. And Yes! He will be revealed as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. He will rule and reign in righteousness. Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord!

Remember to look forward to the hope of Christmas. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
