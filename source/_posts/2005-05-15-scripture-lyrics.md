Here is something I've been working on.

####Verse 1:

Before the foundation of this world was laid,<br/>
By the grace of God, salvation's plan was made.<br/>
Blessed with all blessings in the heavens above.<br/>
I've been chosen to be holy before him in love.

####Chorus:

I was chosen by the Father,<br/>
Redeemed by the Son,<br/>
I'm guarded by the Spirit until the day will come,<br/>
That I will see my saviour and he will take me home. <br/>
