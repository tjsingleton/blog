*Ephesians 2:12-13*

<h2>We are Reconciled to the Bridegroom</h2>

Before we were without God and without hope in this world, but now we are in Christ Jesus. It is this position in Christ that is the foundation of all our riches. The book of Ephesians is bursting at the seams with treasures that are for those in Christ. We are Blessed in Christ (Ephesians 1:1), Chosen in Christ (Ephesians 1:2), Adopted (Ephesians 1:3)… What “unsearchable riches”! (Ephesians 3:8). We now even “have access by one Spirit unto the Father”!

We haven’t always had this position, we were “in times past” without Christ! We had no claim to him. We had no life with him. We were at enmity with him, but he provided a way of reconciliation. Praise His Blessed Name! He made a way that we might be in Christ. What depths of Grace! We are now reconciled to the Bridegroom, and we are...

<h2>We are Received in to the Body</h2>
Not only were we without Christ we were without citizenship. As “Gentiles in the flesh” we had no right to any of the “covenants of promise.” We were “strangers” and “aliens from the commonwealth of Israel”. We were just Gentile dogs. We were nobodies. We had no hope to become anybody either. We were hopeless.

Yet God in his Mercy and Grace saw fit to “reconcile both unto God in one body”. Now we are part of the Body of Christ, which is his Church! This is “the mystery of Christ…That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body”. We were strangers but now we are saints. We were “alien from the commonwealth”, but now we are “fellowcitizens”!

Thank God the he “so loved the world”! That no matter if I am Jew or Gentile I can by trusting in Christ become part of the Family of God and reconciled unto God. How is it that we get such riches of His grace?

<h2>We have these Riches by his Blood</h2>

Nothing we did was to merit this. It’s not be works or anything within me deserves such, but contrary I am wholly undeserving. How is it that a thrice Holy God can reconcile unrighteousness and such vile sinners such as we are?

It was by the shed blood of Christ that for his elect purchased such privileges! It is by that ultimate work of grace that reconciliation was made for his people. It is the cross that is the fountainhead of all our riches. For it was there that Christ became sin for us; it was there that Christ gave his life a ransom for many! It was there by his blood we are made nigh and are now part of the family of God, the Body of Christ and that we are reconciled unto Christ, our Bridegroom. <strong>Bless His Name forever for WORTHY IS THE LAMB!</strong>
