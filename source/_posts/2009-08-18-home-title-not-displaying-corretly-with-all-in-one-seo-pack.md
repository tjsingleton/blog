A client contacted me that the custom home title had stopped working with their install of the All in One SEO Pack. The site was using a home.php file to provide a custom home template. The problem was that in the reading settings "A static page" was selected even though no front page or posts page was selected.

Once updated to "Your latest posts" it worked correctly. Hopefully this will save you some time if you run across the same issue.
