>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

><cite>1 John 4:8</cite>

Have you ever taken (or been forced to participate) in a "Love Quiz" or "Relationship Quiz." I can't recall ever have, and I probably wouldn't admit it either if I had. I have seen them portrayed on TV. I did a little research to make sure I knew what I was talking about. I did a quick search on the ol' google and was not surprised at the popular publication that was the 2nd result. I clicked in to find they many different quizzes. 20 alone that were considered love and relationship.

John has presented us with a little relationship quiz. It's not a very long quiz at all. Just a single question you have to answer. Do you love one another?

The thermometer for you relationship with God is your relationship with the brethren. In verse 7, John states, "Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God." John argues that if love is of God and God is love, then you demonstrate your relationship with God when you share that love with one another.

In verse 9-11, John reminds us of the wonderful proof of God's love in that he "sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins." He did so when we did not love him. That is the kind of love that we should have one for each other; Unconditional, sacrificial love.

John challenged us to love each other and to allow that to be the gauge on our relationship to God. How'd you score?
