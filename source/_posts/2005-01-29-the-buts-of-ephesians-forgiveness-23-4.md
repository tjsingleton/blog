<em>Ephesians 2:1-4</em>

Our Position in verse 1-3 is pretty gloomy. It seems like there is no hope. We see that we are <strong>dead, dominated, disobedient, and damned</strong> in our old condition. We were without worth, we were totally depraved.

<h2>Available Mercy</h2>

Yet we see in Ephesians 2:4 our new condition begins to be examined, and joy floods our heart. The "but" of Ephesians 2:4 changes the tenor of the whole of the passage, now we see the God, who is rich in mercy. O, how merciful he is to have saved a sorry bunch like we were! What is his mercy?

Thayer defines it as, "kindness or good will toward the miserable and afflicted, joined with a desire to relieve them; especially the mercy and clemency of God in providing and offering to men salvation by Christ:" Mercy was God giving us salvation in Christ. Mercy is available.

<h2>Abundant Mercy</h2>

Spurgeon said, "God's mercy is infinite but it always flows to men through the golden channel of Jesus Christ, his son." We see not only that God has mercy but that He is RICH in mercy. He has abundant mercy! We could never plumb the depths of His mercy. Is there mercy enough? Oh yes! He is rich in mercy. There has never been a sinner so vile, so contemptible, so loathsome that God's mercy in Christ couldn't overcome! Mercy is Abundant!

<h2>Availing Mercy</h2>

It is because of God's mercy that we are quickened together (Ephesians 2:5). We have new life with God! Before we were dead and had NO life.

We couldn't respond to God's love, but when His mercy fell on us we were given new life and now the we share our life with God. For what is life for fellowship with Him. Salvation rests on God's Mercy. Thank God it can Avail!

>The Lord is rich and merciful,<br/>
>The Lord is very kind;<br/>
>O come to Him, come now to Him,<br/>
>With a believing mind!<br/>
>His comforts, they shall strengthen thee,<br/>
>Like flowing waters cool;<br/>
>And He shall for thy spirit be<br/>
>A fountain ever full.
