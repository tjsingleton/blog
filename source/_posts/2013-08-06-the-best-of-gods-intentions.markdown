Have you ever felt like your life was irrelevant? That it lacked any rhyme or reason? Our passage clearly states that you were made with a purpose. Your life is no accident. Your life is no coincidence. You were intentionally made.

You were made by God. He has made all things. There is nothing that was not made by him. Paul told the Colossians that, "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:" How awesome it is to consider that you were made by "the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God"?

An even more daunting thought is to contemplate the fact that we were made for God. You were made to please God. He created you that he might enjoy you. In heaven it is sung, "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created."

You have a purpose. God made you for a reason. "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."
