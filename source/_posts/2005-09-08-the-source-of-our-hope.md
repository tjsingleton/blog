This is the first official "Study-Cast" of In Awe of Him Ministries. There was one message prior, but this is the first in the short format style. It's my prayer that these short studies will be a blessing to you and help you to know and love God more.

This study is a follow up from the last, and will continue along the thought of our Hope of Eternal Life in Christ. In the last study we looked at 3 reasons we know our hope is sure. This week we will be looking at the Source of Our Hope. Again the text for the study is found in Titus just a page turn from the last.

So, get your bible out and opened to Titus 3 and let's Study the Scriptures!
