>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

Nothing is as revealing of man's true nature as ingratitude. Have you ever seen the horror that comes across the face of a parent who has just watched their child pitch a fit because that expensive gift was the wrong color? Why is it that we have to teach our children to say thank you? No one has to teach us how to be ungrateful. 

We as Christians should be a brilliant light of thanksgiving against the black night of the world's thanklessness. After all, we have so much to be thankful for. God has done so much for us. Yet, the danger of slipping back into the mire of unappreciation seems ever present.  

Paul informs us of a group of people who knew God. These were not atheist or agnostics. They were aware of God. However, like the child of the horrified parent, they valued the gift more than the giver. They ended up worshipping images, rather than the living God. The downward spiral from vanity to foolishness all started with thanklessness.

Do you know God? Then take a moment and offer our loving Lord a bit of gratitude. Go ahead and thank God for the blessings in your life. Don't fail to glorify him. Don't fail to appreciate and adore him. Don't become a fool.
