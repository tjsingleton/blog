>When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up
>

<h2>The Psalmist’s Condition</h2>
Forsaken, Alone, without help, stripped of all worldly comforts, without the providence of his father, without the tenderness of his mother, when there is no one to turn to, no where to go, no protection to be found, no friend who can aid, when the one’s closest to you are far away, when destitute and orphaned, abandoned and forsaken, when all the world seems against you, outcast and wandering, no one to embrace, no one to defend, no one to succor, no one to strengthen or encourage. When every other tie that binds hearts are dissolved. When it is all just more than you can take. When, “I’m sorry” and “I’ll pray for you” are just quaint gestures.

We notice the:
<h2>The Psalmist’s Comforter</h2>
<h3>The Ability of the Comforter</h3>
When no one else could be there, God can. Where no one else could be, God can. He is able to minister to you when others cannot. He can speak to you in that still small voice when the world around you seems to be crashing in. He can uplift you when the world says that there in no help for him. In the darkest valley, he is there. In the roughest of Life Sea’s, he is there. In the strongest of storms, God is there. Nevertheless, he is able to calm, able to comfort. God is able! Thank God for the ability of the comforter! No matter the circumstances, for he is the master of the circumstances.
<h3>The Love of the Comforter</h3>
It is one thing to have the ability and it is another to exercise it. I may have the ability to give you $20, yet it doesn’t mean I am going to. But thank God for his love, for it allows us access to his ability’s. By his grace, he desires to comfort me. He is that friend who sticks closer than a brother. He is that Shepherd meets my every need, who leads me to the places of refreshment and rejuvenation. The one who anoints my cuts and sores.

Oh I say with the song writer:

>What a Friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear!<br/>
>What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer!<br/>
>O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear,<br/>
>All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.
>
>Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?<br/>
>We should never be discouraged; take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>
>Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our sorrows share?<br/>
>Jesus knows our every weakness; take it to the Lord in prayer.
>
>Are we weak and heavy laden, cumbered with a load of care?<br/>
>Precious Savior, still our refuge, take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>
>Do your friends despise, forsake you? Take it to the Lord in prayer!<br/>
>In His arms He’ll take and shield you; you will find a solace there.
>
>Blessed Savior, Thou hast promised Thou wilt all our burdens bear<br/>
>May we ever, Lord, be bringing all to Thee in earnest prayer.<br/>
>Soon in glory bright unclouded there will be no need for prayer<br/>
>Rapture, praise and endless worship will be our sweet portion there.

When Abraham sent Hagar out with Ishmael and the water was spent. Even Hagar left Ishmael, and sat away from him a good way off. BUT GOD heard the lad, even when his mother couldn’t help, his father could help, God did! O what love!

When Pharaoh said every son should be cast into the river, Moses mother and father set him in a basket and left him in the bulrush! The cries of Moses were not answered by his mother! Nor by his father, But God heard Moses and seen a Egyptian woman, who just happened to be Pharaoh’s daughter! God took a boy left for dead, and led out the nation of Israel!

Thanks to the Love of God we can see the:
<h2>The Psalmist’s Consolation</h2>
The bible says, “He will take me up.” More than just comfort and protection is the psalmist speaking of here his destination. I'm glad for the saved that we have the promise of eternal life with him in heaven. No matter what this world may bring with eyes on heaven I can ever shout and sing.
