>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
>
><cite>Luke 2:14</cite>

This Christmas season, I have spent some time meditating on this verse. I must admit, I have never given it much
consideration. Maybe I passed it over because of it's familiarity. Maybe I missed it because it seems like a common,
quaint saying such as Tiny Tim's "God bless us, every one!" I realized this year though that this was the birth
announcement God sent the world of the birth of his son, Jesus Christ and as such a precious verse.

I am ashamed to admit that I'd reckon if we were penning this chorus we might have left out the first part, or at least
put it last. We often act as if God's primary concern is serving us. I think the angels got it right when they put the
glory of God first. Sure, God showed his good will towards mankind in giving us the Prince of Peace who would die for
our sins, deliver us from the justice we deserved, and grant us peace with God. But, O' how glorious is God for doing
so. In the ages to come we will still be worshiping our Father for his kindness towards us in Christ Jesus. (Eph 2:7)

Just as the Angels started right by putting God's glory first. We should start this year right by doing the same. After
all, if the  Angels have praised him for his mercy to us, should we be found wanting in our praise to him?
