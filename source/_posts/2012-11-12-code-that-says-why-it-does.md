Ben Orenstein really hits the nail on the head with this post. It is a great demonstration of the importance of using an Intention-Revealing Name. I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who struggles with naming things according to purpose. It's not as easy as it sounds. As programmers, we are often so focused on the implementation that it's hard to switch gears to think about intention.
