>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.

><cite>Job 1:5</cite>


The story of Job is so well known that the phrase "The patience of Job" is a common idiom. While Job's determination to serve God in the fire is worthy of consideration, I submit to you that his resolve to serve God in his prosperity is what prepared him for the trials he faced. Job wouldn't have been the man that he was when the trials came if he had not faithfully worshiped God during the time of blessing.


Consider Job's wife. She partook in the same blessings of Job. However, we do not find mention of her ever worshipping the Lord. When she lost her children and saw her husband covered in boils advised Job to, "Curse, God and die." She had not built up the relationship with God that could sustain her through the trials.

Job, on the other hand, had developed a relationship with God. The scripture attests that Job worshipped continually. Without fail Job offered burnt offerings. Repeatedly and regularly Job met with the Lord. His faithfulness provided the faith that he needed when the trials came.

Job put God first. Each morning he rose up and worshipped. He didn't wait until the end of the day to see what the day would bring. Job's worship was based on his blessings. Job's worship was based on his belief. It's that faith that allowed him to say "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."

I challenge you to learn from Jobâ€™s faithfulness, not just in his tribulations, but also in his affluence. Take time to build a relationship with the Lord today. Build up faith now. You do not know what the fire of tomorrow's trials may bring.
