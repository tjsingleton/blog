>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

><cite>Gal 1:4-5</cite>

The proclaimation of Abraham echo in my mind as I read the salutation that Paul inscribed to the Galations. Issac, not knowing that he was it, wanted to know where the sacrfice was for the alter they had just built. Abraham answered, "God will provide himself a lamb." (Gen 22)

Paul reminds us that that God did just that. Our sins demanded a payment, but the price was higher than we could afford. Like Issac, we needed a sacrifice to take our place. It was through Jesus Christ that God provided himself as our lamb. 

What motivated such a wonderful act? It was the will of the Father. Paul wrote to the Romans (9:23) that "he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy." 

Are you a vessel of the Father's mercy? Have you glorified him for it today?
