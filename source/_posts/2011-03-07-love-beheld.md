>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 
>
><cite>1 John 3:1</cite>

Still a bit dewy-eyed with all the festivities of February I thought it appropriate to continue to muse on an topic that is always seasonal for the child of God; The great love of our heavenly Father. Love strong enough to cause a man who was once known as the "son of thunder" to be remembered as leaning on the bosom of Christ. Truly, the love of God is awe inspiring.

John here wants us to be struck with the magnitude of His love for us. He begins with BEHOLD. He wants us to fix our gaze upon this true and inspect it in all it's glory. He wants us to see it's substance and revel in it's wonders. John calls our attention to this truth as he poses the rhetorical question, "What manner of love?" So I echo him in   saying, behold the love of God!

It is described as love bestowed. It's not something we had to earn. Nor could we ever hope to earn it. It's not something we had to beg for. It was freely showered on us while we were yet sinners. God loves us in spite of us. Our Fatherâ€™s love is a great gift and we should treasure it and treat it as such.

Take time to marvel at the soul-satisfying love of God. I leave you with this closing thought. Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so.
