I had a couple a peaches that I didn't think would last until tomorrow. I took advantage of the situation and made a
mini peach cobbler. This is the recipe that my Grandmother used to make, except I used fresh peaches and used only used
a third of the ingredients. It's a bit more tart and less gooey than using canned peaches in syrup.

### Ingredients:

* 3 Peaches
* 1/4 cup of butter
* 1/3 cup Sugar
* 1/3 cup Flour
* 1/3 cup Milk
* Splash of Vanilla

### Directions:

1. Melt the butter and pour it in the pan.

2. Spread the peaches out evenly across the bottom of the pan.

3. Mix the sugar, flour, milk, and vanilla and pour over the peaches.

4. Bake at 350 degrees until the crust is golden brown
