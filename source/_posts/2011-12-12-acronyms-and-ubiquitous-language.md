I enjoyed this post regarding the use of acronyms and Domain-Driven Design. I started to write DDD, but thought it went against the spirit of the post. I recall a statement that Eric Evans made along the lines of "if you can't say something as crisply as you would like, you may need to change the model." I think that was in <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/library/evans_2009_1">What I've learned since the book</a>. If I'm wrong, it's a good presentation anyway.

I'm pretty quick to take a descriptive class name and reduce it to it's shortest recognizable form in written form like emails, chat, and story descriptions. Two that comes to mind is that I shorten ContentLicense to CL or Salesforce to SF. Never in the code, but anyone new to that discussion would need a primer of the various meanings of the acronyms and abbreviations.
