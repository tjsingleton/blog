Too often I find that organizations are too focused on what _agile tools_ to use or adopting a few specific practices.
After all, I find _agile tool_ to be a contradiction of terms. "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"
is the first value proposition of the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/). Focusing on the _right_ tool is
the wrong approach. This article outlines the right approach and the right focus; delivering business value.
