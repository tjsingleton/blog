I just made the switch from wordpress to [octopress](http://octopress.org/). I did this for several reasons. Mainly, I just didn't want to deal with script kiddies trying to exploit my wordpress install. I could understand wanting to have a web ui to update content for a different audience, but wordpress really was overkill for my needs. A nice benefit is speed since the site is generated, static files even with my [cheap web host](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?166574).

Getting started with octopress was easy. Modifying the templates was trivial. So far I'd recommend it for my programmer buddies. Hopefully the change will help me to be more faithful in my writing endeavors, but a tool can only do so much. ;)
